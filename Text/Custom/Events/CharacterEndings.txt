## CharacterEndingTextMCTitle
M. C., One-Hit Wonder[X]

## CharacterEndingTextMCCard
M. C. proceeded to lose in round 2 following his[N]
first victory, and has never won a match since.[N]
However, his one success inspired him to write[N]
his 5th tale at last - featuring a pink-haired[N]
bard saving his friend. It had a happy ending.[X]

## CharacterEndingTextKenriTitle
Kenri, Disaster Master[X]

## CharacterEndingTextKenriCard
Kenri kept assisting whichever Lore Weaver he[N]
deemed most hopeless - usually to disastrous[N]
results, but always a good story. He never saw[N]
M. C. again, yet fondly remembered their time[N]
together despite his newfound phobia of extras.[X]

## CharacterEndingTextAthenaTitle
Athena, Chicken Mad[X]

## CharacterEndingTextAthenaCard
Following her disastrous showing at The Pen, all[N]
future Zigludo's Records entries featured horrid[N]
beasts masquerading as chickens. She quickly[N]
faded into obscurity, until 50 years later when[N]
the genre of avian horror was established.[X]

## CharacterEndingTextNogistTitle
Nogist, Free At Last[X]

## CharacterEndingTextNogistCard
Nogist assisted a Lore Weaver one more time,[N]
which led to the most one-sided match in The[N]
Pen's history. She was then forbidden from[N]
ever setting foot in the arena again, to[N]
everyone's relief - especially hers.[X]

## CharacterEndingTextEmceeTitle
Emcee, Forever Loud[X]

## CharacterEndingTextEmceeCard
While the aptly-named Emcee loved his job at[N]
The Pen, it had an unfortunate impact on his[N]
ability to speak at non-ear shattering volumes.[N]
Still, he claimed it was but a small price to pay[N]
in order to see every single match first hand.[X]

## CharacterEndingTextGameMasterTitle
The Game Master[X]

## CharacterEndingTextGameMasterCard
Nobody knows the Game Master's real name,[N]
where she came from, how her powers work,[N]
why she runs The Pen, who is the skeleton[N]
in her closet, what she ate for breakfast,[N]
or when will her cat leave my lap.[X]

## CharacterEndingTextButlerTitle
Random Guard, Storyteller[X]

## CharacterEndingTextButlerCard
And that was the story of M. C.'s first victory[N]
and everything that happened afterwards.[N]
What's that? Oh, you were asking about Seris'[N]
first match? Of course, silly me. Our story begins[N]
at May 14th, 11:54, in the arena's entrance...[X]
