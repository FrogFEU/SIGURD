## EOC2136SummonTale
[Red]Zigludo's Records of Supernatural[N]
Creatures & Phenomena, entry [hashtag]2136:[Red][AN]
[hashtag]2136 takes on the appearance of a[N]
centaur with a flaming head.[AN]
According to local myths surrounding a[N]
similar creature, it is the burnt body of[N]
a formerly benevolent beast, which seeks[N]
to avenge all who were similarly wronged.[AN]
While the veracity of this legend's story[N]
is currently unproven, the description of[N]
[hashtag]2136's behaviour appears to match all[N]
recorded instances of its appearance:[AN]
the destruction of another supernatural[N]
creature has always led to [hashtag]2136's[N]
manifestation, and the offending party's[N]
swift demise.[A][X]

## EOC3811SummonTale
[Red]Zigludo's Records of Supernatural[N]
Creatures & Phenomena, entry [hashtag]3811:[Red][AN]
[hashtag]3811 appears as a masked humanoid[N]
wearing heavy robes.[AN]
Its only observable action is the creation[N]
of a seemingly unlimited amount of life-sized[N]
dolls, with similar abilities to the people in[N]
[hashtag]3811's close vicinity.[AN]
These dolls appear to mimic the behaviour[N]
of their inspiration, and will turn violent[N]
if approached in kind.[.4] [hashtag]3811 itself tends to[N]
ignore all around it, and no attempts at[N]
communications have succeeded.[AN]
Nevertheless, harming it triggers a sudden[N]
and equivalent retribution, and is thus[N]
ill-advised.[A][X]


## EOC5397SummonTale
[Red]Zigludo's Records of Supernatural[N]
Creatures & Phenomena, entry [hashtag]5397:[Red][AN]
While dormant, [hashtag]5397 is invisible to the[N]
naked eye, aside from the reflection of[N]
a flame on nearby metal surfaces.[AN]
It appears to be activated by the[N]
presence of blood in its vicinity.[AN]
Upon activation, the sound of a[N]
blacksmith's hammer will be heard[N]
across the surrounding area.[AN]
Afterwards, [hashtag]5397 will begin assembling[N]
itself, seemingly out of thin air - first[N]
a sword, then a metal suit.[.4][N]
Evidence suggests it has one more form,[N]
yet no records remain of it.[A][X]

## EOC6048SummonTale
[Red]Zigludo's Records of Supernatural[N]
Creatures & Phenomena, entry [hashtag]6048:[Red][AN]
It is difficult to observe [hashtag]6048 directly,[N]
as a thick fog tends to manifest wherever[N]
it goes.[AN]
The recommended way to detect [hashtag]6048's[N]
presence is the sound of laughter[N]
emanating from within said fog.[AN]
According to reports, at the fog's source[N]
resides a small child with an unnatural[N]
disposition.[.4] Once the child is approached, it[N]
will attempt playing with its visitor, with[N]
often lethal outcomes.[AN]
Should one enter the fog, it is imperative[N]
to stay away from the child to ensure[N]
successful survival.[A][X]
