[Beat][N][.5]
[Beat][AN][CloseEyes]
Come on, please don't be late[Beat][AN]
Things are looking bad enough[N]
already, we don't need-[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[FFL][LoadMC][ToggleSmile]
[MLeft]
I have arrived.[A]
[MR][OpenEyes][MMR]
Oh, great![.4] You're[N]
M. C. Illios, right?[A]
[Left]
Indeed.[A]
[MR][MMR]
Awesome![.4][N]
I'm Kenri, your assistant for this match.[AN]
Haven't read any of your works, but let[N]
me tell you, I'm a huge fan![A]
[Left]
[Beat]A fan of what, if not my tales?[A]
[MR]
Oh, you know, that whole loss streak[N]
thing you've got going on.[AN]
Participating for the sixth time[N]
without winning a single match?[AN][MMR]
Now that's dedication![A]
[Left][MLeft]
T-That is no thing to be a fan of![AN]
Besides, my previous failures were[N]
caused solely by bad luck.[AN]
My stories are of the highest[N]
quality - if you-[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Sure, sure. Listen, you're here[N]
to win this thing, yeah?[A]
[Left][MLeft][ToggleSmile]
But of course![A]
[MR]
Excellent! So am I![AN]
Which tales did you[N]
bring this time?[A]
[Left]
The same ones I always do.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Wait.[.5] Uh.[AN]
You brought the same characters[N]
you lost with before?[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Yes.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]And you expect[N]
to win this time?[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
Obviously.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Right[Beat] 
Okay then.[.5] Um.[AN]
Do you know who our[N]
opponent is?[A]
[Left][ToggleSmile]
I have no interest[N]
in lesser writers.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
What? Oh no.[N]
Listen, she's-[A]
[FL][LoadButler][ToggleSmile]
The match is starting now.[AN]
If you would be so kind as[N]
to step onto the arena?[A]
[Left]
Gladly.[A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[Left][ClearFace]
[FL][ClearFace]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Oh boy.[AN][CloseEyes]
Maybe volunteering to help the Mad Chicken[N]
wasn't such a good idea after all[Beat][AN][ToggleSmile][OpenEyes]
Oh well, too late now, might as well[N]
give this my all![A][X]

## StartEventTextEmcee1
[Right][LoadEmcee][MRight]
Welcome one, [MRight]welcome all,[.5] to The Pen -[.5][N]
where fictions clash and realities shatter![AN]
Now that the dust has finally settled from[N]
our previous match,[A] and the smell of undead[N]
cheese no longer fills the air,[A] it is high[N]
time for another battle -[A] one which will[N]
surely rock your socks![AN]
[MRight]Are you people ready?![A][X]

## StartEventTextEmcee2
[Left][LoadEmcee]
For our first combatant, we have the latest[N]
rising star of Lore Weaving,[A] who recently[N]
took the literary world by storm![AN]
Armed with her seemingly endless series of[N]
Zigludo's Records, she is ready for anything![AN]
But are you ready for her?[AN]
Everyone, it is time for [MLeft]the one, [MLeft]the only[Beat][N]
[Red][MLeft]Athena[MLeft] Perfect[Red]![A][X]

## StartEventTextEnterAthena
[ML][LoadMA]
[MR][LoadEvilApprentice]
[ML][CloseEyes]
Ah[Beat][OpenEyes] Hear that, my dearest apprentice?[.5][N][CloseEyes]
The boundless enthusiasm of the crowds.[AN][OpenEyes]
Treasure this moment, for only a rare[N]
few get to bask in my shadow.[A]
[MR]
Woo.[A]
[ML]
Although, considering our opponent[Beat][AN]
Hmhmhmh. Why, I have a feeling we shall[N]
hear even greater cheers soon enough.[A]
[MR]Yay.[A][X]

## StartEventTextEmcee3
[Right][LoadEmcee]
Facing her, stands a very familiar face.[AN]
[MRight]That's right! He's back and he's angry - for[N]
no foe is too mighty for the Mad Chicken![AN]
Will he finally redeem himself, or will[N]
this be yet another crushing defeat?[AN]
Anything is possible in The Pen, but one[N]
thing is certain - [Red][MRight]M. [MRight]C. [MRight]Illios[Red] is here![A][X]

## StartEventTextEnterMC
[MR][LoadMC]
[ML][LoadApprentice]
[MR][MMR]
My name is not Mad Chicken![N]
It is Maximilian Cornelius![A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Right, yeah, I knew that.[AN]
Anyway, this is what I was talking about:[AN]
Athena must have hand-picked tales to[N]
mess with yours, so uh, be careful.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Hmpf. Coming with anything[N]
but your very best works?[AN]
What foolishness.[A]
[ML][ToggleSmile][HalfCloseEyes]
Yep, there's foolishness here,[N]
all right.[A][X]

## StartEventTextEmcee4
[Left][LoadEmcee]
Our esteemed actors have arrived, yet[N]
a stage remains nowhere to be seen.[AN]
Who shall save us from this foul conundrum?[AN]
Well, there is only one person capable[N]
of such an extraordinary feat.[AN]
[MLeft]Yes, you know it! It is finally[N]
time for[Beat] the [Red][MLeft]Game [MLeft]Master[Red]![A][X]

## StartEventTextEnterGameMaster
[Right][LoadGameMaster][ToggleColorInvert]
[ToggleMouthMove].[.6].[.6].[.6][ToggleMouthMove][AN][LoadOverworldFaces]
One grows with conflict.[AN]
The other with time.[AN]
The solution is elementary.[AN]
There shall be extras.[AN]
Opposition and protection.[AN]
Generate stage 77,[N]
variant 6.[AN]
I have spoken.[A][X]

## StartEventTextEmcee5
[Left][LoadEmcee][MLeft]
Amazing! [MLeft]Incredible! [MLeft]Sublime![N][.5]
What an astonishing performance![AN]
And now, without further ado:[N]
[MLeft]let [MLeft]the storytelling [MLeft]begin![A][X]

## StartEventTextExtrasReaction
[ML][LoadApprentice]
[MR][LoadMC]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Woah, those sure are a lot of extras.[AN]
And[Beat] are all of them seriously[N]
going to exclusively fight us?[A]
[MR]
Indeed.[A]
[ML]
What?! [MML]That's completely unfair![AN]
These are supposed to be four-on-four[N]
matches, not four-on-thirty million![A]
[MR]
Heh. Worry not.[AN]
My tales [Red]feed on adversity[Red], and[N]
we have a bounty of it now.[A]
[ML]
Right, silly me, seeing armed fighters[N]
as a threat instead of food.[AN][Blink]
Wait.[.5] Um.[.4][Blink][Blink] Not.[.5][N]
Not feed literally, right?[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
What? [MMR]No, of course not![AN][CloseEyes]
Hmph. You shall see.[A]
[MR][ClearFace]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
[Beat]Is it too late to play dead?[A][X]
