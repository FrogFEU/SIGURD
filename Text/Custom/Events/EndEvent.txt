I[Beat][CloseEyes] I did it.[.5][OpenEyes] I won.[.5][N][MML]
I have won a match in The Pen![A]
[MR]
We did it, you mean.[.5][N]
Together.[A]
[ML]
Yes. Your performance[N]
was[Beat] adequate.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Seriously? You could just[N]
say thank you, you know.[A]
[ML]
I[Beat] appreciate your help.[A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Wow.[ToggleSmile] You know what, never mind.[AN]
I've done my part, and your[N]
streak is finally broken.[AN]
That's what matters![A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Indeed![A]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
And now, it is time for me to go.[AN]
Good luck with the rest![A]
[ML]
Wait. Will you not assist[N]
me in the next matches?[A]
[MR]
Nope. I mean, you got your happy[N]
ending already.[AN]
Or at least, a happy moment, and[N]
that's good enough for me.[A]
[ML][MML]
This was only the first round![N][MML]
There are seven more![A]
[MR]
Yeah, and that means seven more hopeless[N]
participants for me to save.[AN]
Did you hear about Harley?[AN]
Last year, none of her characters managed to[N]
land a single hit through an entire match.[AN]
And they were fighting plants, of all things![A]
[ML]
[Beat]I did not.[A]
[MR]
Well, I did. Anyway, don't worry, I'll[N]
recommend them to assign Nogist to you.[AN]
She's a real ray of sunshine, that one -[N]
you'll work great together![AN]
But I really gotta run now, so uh,[N]
see you around, Mad Chicken![A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MFFL][ClearFace]
[ML]
That is not- [MML]And I am not hopeless either![AN]
[ClearFace][LoadMCMirrored]
Wait! Come back! [MML]Please![A][N][CloseSpeechSlow]
